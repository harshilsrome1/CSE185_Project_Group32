## Description

The Gibbs Sampler Motif Finding Tool is a command-line Python application designed to identify motifs within a given set of DNA sequences. It implements the Gibbs sampling algorithm, which iteratively selects k-mers from DNA sequences to find the most significant motifs. This tool is modeled after the MEME suite but specifically uses a stochastic approach to motif discovery.
