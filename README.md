## Description

The Gibbs Sampler Motif Finding Tool is a command-line Python application designed to identify motifs within a given set of DNA sequences. It implements the Gibbs sampling algorithm, which iteratively selects k-mers from DNA sequences to find the most significant motifs. This tool is modeled after the [MEME](https://meme-suite.org/meme/doc/meme.html?man_type=web) (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation) tool but specifically uses a randomized approach to motif discovery.
